# Project-Vibes
Bards in their sophomore year from the Virtuoso Conservatory for Symphonic Combative Arts are tasked with practical field tests such as Harmonic Defense whilst partaking in a traditional pilgrimage to attain their sound. Listen to their song for it tells tall tales of their travels and growth and unravel the dissonance against the bardic oath.
